"""
Define a function called count that has two 
arguments called sequence and item.

Return the number of times the item occurs 
in the list.

For example: count([1, 2, 1, 1], 1) should return 3 
(because 1 appears 3 times in the list).

There is a list method in Python that you can use 
for this, but you should do it the long way for practice.

Your function should return an integer.

The item you input may be an integer, string, float, or 
even another list!

Be careful not to use list as a variable name in 
your codeâ€”it's a reserved word in Python!
